# Introduction 

This repo is part of a research titled **"Penalty Function and Particle Swarm in Solving the Optimal Power Flow Problem with discrete control variables."**
The Optimal Power Flow Problem is a very relevant problem in the area of Electrical Engineering.
In this research, we will develop programs in python to Optimize Electrical Power Systems through the *Optimal Reactive Power Flow* problem with an algorithm called *Particle Swarm Optimization* integrated with Penalty Functions.

# Particle Swarm Optimization
TBD - Yarpiz library (read readme inside ./yarpiz folder)
